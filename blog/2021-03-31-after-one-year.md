# After one year

## O'Clock bootcamp ðŸš€

As I wrote in my previous article, I started O'Clock bootcamp, in the Fullstack JS program of 6 months. As expected, it was an intensive program. Great teachers, a real team spirit and efficient training materials made me gain so much hard and soft skills. I met wonderful people who became great colleagues and friends. I worked on many interesting projects that you can find here on my [GitHub](https://github.com/SpookyUmi). 

I know that many people think that bootcamps are not as efficient as a college program of several years. I genuinely think that's not true. No matter the way you choose, learning on your own, following a college program or following a bootcamp. What makes the difference is your determination, your enthusiasm and of course the skills you gained in your learning process. In my bootcamp, I met a lot of different people with different backgrounds. And for the most of us, we are motivated and I'm convinced we will succeed. Web development requires dedication, training a bit everyday, stay up to date and ready to search for the information. In the end, no matter where you come from, if you maintain your hard and soft skills and if you're motivated, you can make it ! That's what I learnt during this one year long journey, and that's what I believe in.
