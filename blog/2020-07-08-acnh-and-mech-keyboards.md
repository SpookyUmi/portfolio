# Animal Crossing New Horizons

It's time for another hobby of mine that I love. It's (almost) not about code, but it's about gaming. More precisely about Animal Crossing, the top one COVID-19 game, haha. You've surely heard about New Horizons, but of course there are previous opus such as Wild World and New Leaf. I've been playing this game since a long time ago and it always amazed me because it's full of possibilities and cuteness. One thing to say is that the developers behind this game are geniuses.

Animal Crossing is a real breath of fresh air to me. You can your own town or island to your liking and decorate your house. You make friends with cute animals villagers, catch insects and fish, watch shouting stars... In the New Horizons opus, you can even restructure your island by building mountains, rivers, paths and moving the houses.
