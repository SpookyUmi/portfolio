# Animal Crossing New Horizons

It's time for another hobby of mine that I love. It's (almost) not about code, but it's about gaming. More precisely about Animal Crossing, the top one COVID-19 game, haha. You've surely heard about New Horizons, but of course there are previous opus such as Wild World and New Leaf. I've been playing this game since a long time ago and it always amazed me because it's full of possibilities and cuteness. One thing to say is that the developers behind this game are geniuses.
