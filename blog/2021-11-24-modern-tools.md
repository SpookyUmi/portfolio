As developers, we all have our own reasons to experiment the newest tools : it can be fun and challenging, it can make our experience of coding way much smoother, faster and efficient, and it can push us to improve ourselves. As users, we also want our experience navigating through websites and apps to be fast, reactive, and sometimes even further to fulfill personal criterias regarding ecology or ethics. 

I for one am interested in building websites that are fast and intuitive, but not only. We developers love to use a ton of packages, tricks and tools to improve our apps, but this process can end up having a certain cost. We end up building heavier and heavier projects, our apps are slower to launch and our users need to load more and more data. For me, delivering a lighter app is as important as the rest. 

- Vite and NextJS
- pNpm 
- Image Optimization
- Config ESlint / prettier ?
