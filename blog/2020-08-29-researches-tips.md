# I want to find the answers I'm looking for ! üò•

You're a beginner dev and you're **lost** when you need to **search** something ? Don't know what to write or **which website** to click on ? Or you just need a **cheatsheet** which gathers **tips and resources** together ? Here we go !!  
I've been struggling about how to do an **efficient search**, not finding what I want and spending time and energy on how to formulate my problem. But we can always _improve ourselves_ ! Today I decided to **share** the advices I've been told and the good websites and references I found.

## Improve your searching skills üí™

- Before searching a solution, don't hesitate to **try out** things and most of all to **use your browser inspector**. This one is your best friend, especially when you embed your page's elements using _HTML_ and _CSS_.  

- Try to find the **right keyword(s)** that describes the solution you're looking for or the problem you run into. For **example**, if your search is about a problem in _JavaScript_, you'll need to use the **correct vocabulary**, like _"javascript convert sentence to value"_ should be _"javascript convert string to integer/number"_.

- **Show your code** ! You can't just say "My code isn't working, this div won't align with the other one", because nobody will be able to help you without further informations. It's important to **describe your problem and to show your code** at the same time.

- **Check the date** on the results. Tech is fast, and some solutions from a few years ago are out-of-date.


## Good references ‚≠êÔ∏è

### MDN my love

Of course, I can't talk about the ways to make a search without mentioning the good resources you'll find and how to use it. That's why I'll tell you more about [**MDN**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). This **web documentation** by Mozilla is a _treasure_ to all developers. But nothing's perfect, right ? So I recommend to **not type directly into the MDN website** search field. The documentation is so _abundant_ that you'll find different results for a same word. For **example**, if you're looking for the **`background` CSS property** page by typing _"background"_ or even _"background css"_, you'll get a LOT of **different articles**, and most of the time not the one you're looking for on top.  
Instead of that, go directly on your **search engine** (Google or whatever) and type, to continue our example, _"background css mdn"_. This will **target** instantly the article you're looking for. A simple trick to avoid too much scrolling. 

### Stackoverflow

If you search for a **solution** to your code problem using several keywords, you'll probably see the [**Stackoverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com/) Question section on top result. And that's nice because it's a **good reference** ! But don't forget to always **check the date** and to read the solution but also the question, to make sure the solution is valid.
