My first week of learning was really *rich*. First, I followed **Grafikart**'s HTML [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwdMgw5TTLUeixVGPNl1uZNeJy4UY6qX) : I finished it within 3 days, created my first **HTML** [website](https://spookyumi.github.io/grafikart_html/), and shared my code to my **GitHub**'s [repository](https://github.com/SpookyUmi/grafikart_html). Then, I followed **Wes Bos**' Markdown [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7v7K5nZSMo9XWidbJ_Bns3). <br>

Fortunately, I'm not alone in that process, I've a great teacher who guides me through these first steps.
He taught me how to use *Github's repository*, and how to *commit* and to *push* my productions through Ubuntu's terminal thanks to "Git" commands. <br>

And because there's no small victories, I feel happy just by mastering more *keyboard shortcuts*. Thanks to that, I feel really efficient when using my laptop and my apps, as well as I feel even more **motivated** to continue my "developer training" for the days ahead. <br>

### Next steps :
- Learning CSS
- Learning JS

Gambatte to me !! üí™
