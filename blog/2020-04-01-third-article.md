# A little fun

I started to learn CSS thanks to Grafikart's [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwdMgw5TTLVjTZQocrMwKicV5wsZlRpj) on YouTube, and Flexbox' tools with Wes Bos' [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7xj_y6NIAhy0wuCd4uVdid). Regularly, I took little breaks at some point of the playlists and trained with 3 games I discovered this last week ! And believe me, you'll need some breaks throughout your learning process. Those games are a great mix between resting and training your skills. In some way, they materialize tools and functions that can sometimes leave us a very abstract feeling right after a course. Well, I let you discover those cute and tricky games !

This [game](https://flukeout.github.io/) was the first I tried (and succeed !). It's about CSS' selectors : their nature and how their rules interact with each other.

![Example](/blog/images/03_2_third_article_picture.png)

A CSS selector is the part of a CSS rule that describes what elements in a document the rule will match. The matching elements will have the rule's specified style applied to them. Your selector can be an single element, such as body. But it can also be a class, such as "yolo" : then all your elements with the class "yolo" will match the rule's specified style. You can also use an ID, like "unicorn", then the style of all your "unicorn" elements will be set. But let's go back to our game. In CSS Diner, you'll explore selectors' possibilities for 32 levels by releasing cute and bouncing items such as plates, bentos and fruits. Go try it out ! ðŸ˜„
