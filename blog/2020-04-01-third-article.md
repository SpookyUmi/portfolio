# A little fun

I started to learn CSS thanks to Grafikart's course on YouTube, and Flexbox' specifities with Wes Bos' playlist. Regularly, I took little breaks at some points of the playlists and trained with 3 games I discovered this last week !

## CSS Diner

This game was the first I tried (and succeed !), it's about CSS' selectors.
