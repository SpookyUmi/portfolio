# How I ended up learning web development ?

## About me

I'm a 23 years old french woman and I'm from Bordeaux, France. I'm a creative being, and since as long as I can remember, I love to draw, write and sing. I'm not a pro in those fields but I love to share my creations or my voice with my loved ones. Today I'd like to share some drawing on this blog. I can't share my voice yet but don't worry, I keep singing and I plan to realize a nice project !

As you can see I love Ghibli's universe. Here's a Porco Rosso inspiration drawing ! I made it thanks to Procreate on my iPad pro. It's a really instinctive app to draw using calque. It offers many different brushes but you can also create your own or add downloaded brushes to your inventory. The feeling is almost paperlike, with added possibilities !

I'm also a horse enthusiast since 2004, so I'm far from being a senior dev but I can say I'm a senior rider, haha. I can talk about horses and horsemanship for hours. But I'll only share two thoughts about this subject :
- Keep a critical mind when someone tell you about horses and how they comprehend them.
- Always remember that this sport involves an intelligent and sensitive being who communicates through a different language that you must try to understand. "Art is the result of skill exalted by love" - *(L'art, c'est la sublimation de la technique par l'amour)* [*Nuno Oliveira*](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuno_Oliveira)

## My student journey

I've always been searching inspiration for studies without finding it. I tried different fields, like biology, and more recently, speech therapy that I've been learning for 3 years. I struggled a lot thinking about quiting but deceiving my family and friends at the same time. And I struggled with this important question : "What do I want to do with my life ?" I'm not sure of the answer, but I know that I want to do something I like, something that allows me to express myself and to keep learning new stuff. I also love to create content and to know how things work in the background. So I searched in more artistic and creative fields, and after [kissu](https://twitter.com/kissu_io) told me more about web development and bring me to a meetup, I started my learning.

And that, dear reader, is how I met web development. haha

## What's up after 1 month ?

I started my learning the 16th of March thanks to kissu who's mentoring me. Here's a non exhaustive list of what I've learned during this month :
- HTML and attributes
- Many shortkeys
- Typing on a qwerty ANSI HHKB keyboard
- Git commands on Linux Terminal (especially git init, add, commit and push)
- Github
- VScode
- CSS, Flexbox and CSSgrid

Aaaaand... I began learning JS since yesterday night (03.14.20) ! I follow [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)' course.

I have to say that I really love what I'm currently learning. The possibilities are infinite and I'm sure I'll find my place in web development, especially in frontend. I'll see where I go !
