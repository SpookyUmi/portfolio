Today I write about the *process* and people behind this **Portfolio** ! You're here on one of Gridsome's *babies*. [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org) is a *static site generator* powered by **VueJS**.

In fact, as VueJS is a *framework* for **JavaScript**, Gridsome is also a framework for VueJS. It provides an easy path to build your website as well as some premade projects. I choose [Andre Madarang](https://github.com/drehimself)'s portfolio and blog [starter](https://gridsome-portfolio-starter.netlify.com/). A big thanks to Andre's work, by the way !

Then, I created a domain's name and purchased a suffix on Google Domains, and with [kissu](https://github.com/kissu) (my mentor, a huge thanks to him !), we started to design and write the website's sections. Thanks to **JAMstack**, kissu hosted and customized my site to my liking. We *pushed* our project on [Github](https://github.com/SpookyUmi/portfolio), and from the repository, we sent the code to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (yay, CDN !), the platform which allows my portfolio to be online.

I have to admit that this article was a bit rough to write. As I'm a beginner, I'm not completely aware about all the links that rule this system. But I try to understand the interactions and I'll improve in the weeks ahead. 😊
