# What is a "responsive design" ? üñ•

When you **build** a website, you want it to be _reachable_ and _functional_ on a **desktop**'s screen, obviously, but also on a **laptop**, a **tablet** or a **mobile** phone. Congratulations, you've learnt the first part of what means "responsive" !

Nowadays **different types of devices** appear every day with tons of different screens, sizes and functionalities. When you build an app or a website, you can't make it work with pixel perfect (even if it can be satisfying), you must **adapt** and provide its functionalities for a maximum of machines. But **responsiveness doesn't only depend on the device**, it's also **changing according to the browser** you use. Not all browsers can support all the existent properties. It means you have to **anticipate** and manage your code to suit a lot of different situations. For example, if you're planning on using CSSgrid to organize your website's elements, _make sure your client is not using an old browser or an uncommon one_. To do so, go visit [Can I Use](https://caniuse.com/), an ingenious website where you can check browser support tables for a lot of properties and formats.

## How can I build a responsive website or web app ? ‚öôÔ∏è

### Media query

Let's talk about **media queries**. Basically, it's a **CSS rule** which allows you to organize your site or your app depending on a _device's type_ or more _specific parameters_. You can use the `@media` rule and choose the type you need : `screen` or `print` (good to know : you can use them together or separately). Then, you can specify the specific **parameters** of your targeted device, usually based on the _screen resolution_ or the browser _viewport width_. The most commonly used parameters are `max-width` and `min-width`, which we configure with px unit.

### Breakpoints & mobile-first approach üì±

These last parameters, `max-width` and `min-width`, are very useful to create what we call **breakpoints**. For example, when I start to style my HTML with CSS, I go **mobile-first**. Well, I hear you say "What ?! This is too much ! "Breakpoint", and then "mobile-first" ?!". Easy, easy, let's finish this example. Mobile-first concretely means that you firstly build the design for mobile devices, in other words for the **smaller resolution** your website or web app can handle. Then, based on your mobile design, you create _media queries rules_ for larger resolutions. Why ? Quite simply because **smaller device or resolution = lighter design**. It's easier and it requires less lines of CSS to start with a simple design, and then modify it to make it more complex for a larger screen. To do so, I set up what we call a **breakpoint** : I choose a width from which I change the design to adapt it to a larger screen. It's written like this :

``` css
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {}
```

Concretely, you can translate it as _"Starting from 1024px, I'll apply the following style rules"_. So satisfying, huh ?

## What does it looks like ? üëÄ

Now here are two gifs who show the screen size responsiveness. In the **first**, you can see a responsive website : when I reduce the screen size, the design adapts.

In the **second** gif, you can see a non responsive design : it simply doesn't adapt to different sizes and the design breaks.

And that's it ! Feel free to review this article and to send me some feedback. Bye ! üòÑ
