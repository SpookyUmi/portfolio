## About me
![Umi](./blog/images/about_me_avatar.jpg)
Hi ! I'm Chloe Danisevicius, a creative and inventive person. I express myself through **artistic hobbies** that I'd love to share on this blog, such as *writing*, *drawing* and *singing*. <br>
I'm 23 and I've been studying Speech Therapy until I heard more about **web development** in 2020. Since then, I'm an enthusiast young developer and I intend to write about my discoveries, my improvements and my projects !

## Projects, skills and tech
**After one week of learning, I know :**
- HTML
- Markdown <br>

**I discovered and learn to use :** 

- Sublime Text & Visual Studio Code
- Linux Ubuntu
- Git & Github

**Projects :**

1. Continue to learn development's languages
2. Create my own website about writing and drawing using HTML, CSS and JS

## My first steps
My first week of learning was really *rich*. First, I followed **Grafikart**'s HTML [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjwdMgw5TTLUeixVGPNl1uZNeJy4UY6qX) : I finished it within 3 days, created my first **HTML** [website](https://spookyumi.github.io/grafikart_html/), and shared my code to my **GitHub**'s [repository](https://github.com/SpookyUmi/grafikart_html). Then, I followed **Wes Bos**' Markdown [course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7v7K5nZSMo9XWidbJ_Bns3). <br>

Fortunately, I'm not alone in that process, I've a great teacher who guides me through these first steps.
He taught me how to use *Github's repository*, and how to *commit* and to *push* my productions through Ubuntu's terminal thanks to "Git" commands. <br>

And because there's no small victories, I feel happy just by mastering more *keyboard shortcuts*. Thanks to that, I feel really efficient when using my laptop and my apps, as well as I feel even more **motivated** to continue my "developer training" for the days ahead. <br>

##### Next steps : 
- Learning CSS
- Learning JS

Gambatte to me !!
